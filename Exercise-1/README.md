# Notes on commonly used PCL filters  
Five kinds of filters are introduced as below.
* VoxelGrid Downsampling Filter
* PassThrough Filter
* RANSAC Plane Fitting
* ExtractIndices Filter
* Outlier Removal Filter(statistical outlier filter)

## 1. VoxelGrid Downsampling Filter

A voxel grid filter allows you to downsample the data by taking a spatial average of the points in the cloud confined by each voxel. You can adjust the sampling size by setting the voxel size along each dimension. The set of points which lie within the bounds of a voxel are assigned to that voxel and statistically combined into one output point.


## 2. PassThrough Filter

The Pass Through Filter works much like a cropping tool, which allows you to crop any given 3D point cloud by specifying an axis with cut-off values along that axis. The region you allow to pass through, is often referred to as region of interest.

## 3. RANSAC Plane Fitting

First, a hypothetical shape of the desired model is generated by randomly selecting a minimal subset of n-points and estimating the corresponding shape-model parameters.

Once a model is established, the remaining points in the point cloud are tested against the resulting candidate shape to determine how many of the points are well approximated by the model.

After a certain number of iterations, the shape that possesses the largest percentage of inliers is extracted and the algorithm continues to process the remaining data.

## 4. ExtractIndices Filter

ExtractIndices Filter allows you to extract points from a point cloud by providing a list of indices.


## 5. Outlier Removal Filter(statistical outlier filter)

It perform a statistical analysis in the neighborhood of each point, and remove those points which do not meet a certain criteria.

By assuming a Gaussian distribution, all points whose mean distances are outside of an interval defined by the global distances mean+standard deviation are considered to be outliers and removed from the point cloud.





# Tabletop Segmentation

In this exercise you'll get a chance to apply some filtering techniques and use RANSAC plane fitting to segment the table in your point cloud.  

### Note: This exercise requires Python 2 due to the Python bindings to PCL being used here.  If you installed Python via Anaconda using the RoboND-Python-Starterkit, you have Python 3 installed in your RoboND conda environment so this exercise won't work.  

### The VM provided by Udacity comes with Python 2 installed as the default so if you are running the VM, or have Python 2 installed locally, you should have no problem.

To follow along with a detailed walkthrough of this project please see the [Calibration, Filtering and Segmentation](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd209/parts/586e8e81-fc68-4f71-9cab-98ccd4766cfe/modules/e5bfcfbd-3f7d-43fe-8248-0c65d910345a/lessons/8d51e0bf-0fa1-49a7-bd45-e062c4a2121f/concepts/02cbb56e-9e54-4c08-977b-df149cb0bca4) lesson from RoboND.

In brief, the steps to complete this exercise are the following:

1. Downsample your point cloud by applying a Voxel Grid Filter.
2. Apply a Pass Through Filter to isolate the table and objects.
3. Perform RANSAC plane fitting to identify the table.
4. Use the ExtractIndices Filter to create new point clouds containing the table and objects separately.
